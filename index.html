          <h1>About The Author:</h1>
          <h3>Dave Bell is a musician, worship leader, songwriter and the lead singer of The Moment.
           He spends his time Living Life Out Loud.</h3>
          <p>In 2003, aged 16, Dave Bell was diagnosed with a very rare and aggressive cancer that was attacking the back of his right eye. The outlook was bleak. Dave had to undergo 6 months of intense chemotherapy and 25 sessions of intense radiotherapy. He was confronted with the fact that his life may be cut short, but through this grasped the truth that God would heal him and bring him through. Today Dave is completely healthy and continuing to share his story of healing around the world.</p>
			<br />
			<span style="color:#cfc802;">
		  	 <p>Dave married Sarah in the summer of 2007. The doctors had told Dave that he would never be able to have children because of the treatment he had endured, but against all the odds Dave and Sarah now have two little boys, Jackson and Levi.</p>
		  	</span>
			<br />
		  <p>Many lessons were learned during Dave&#39;s treatment and breakthrough to recovery. Not just about God&#39;s desire to heal, but about His desire for us to live life for all we are worth. This guide to living life OUT LOUD will inspire and reinvigorate your walk with God. It reminds us that, although we must always face the facts, the Truth is always greater than the facts.</p>
