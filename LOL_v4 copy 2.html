    FOREWORD</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Dave and I first made contact following on from a forum for young leaders I
    was involved in. I encouraged those gathered to drop me a line if they
    wanted to, and to share their stories with me. Dave wrote to me and told me
    some of his background and his remarkable story of God’s goodness to him
    and his family. I was both deeply moved and profoundly encouraged by his
    testimony and felt God impress upon me that here was a young man with a
    distinct purpose in His plans.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Since then we have kept in touch. I keep a folder on my computer desktop
    containing a number of Dave’s original worship songs and have shared these
    with our worship leaders here at Saddleback. Dave has a gift for
    communicating the life of God in an authentic way through his music. Now
    he's doing the same in print.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    The full version of Dave's journey towards complete healing from a rare and
    aggressive form of cancer can be found in the book Mud In The Eye. But in
    this book, Dave shares the lessons of faith that he and his family learnt
    through that journey. Having been given a second chance at life, Dave has
    determined to live it for all he is worth, according to God's purposes for
    him. Years ago, the phrase Carpe Diem - Seize the day was popular. I think
    I prefer Life Out Loud. It captures much better the truth that can live
    with purpose for the long run.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 51pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    This is a powerful story that reminds us that we serve a powerful God. I
    commend to you both Dave's ministry and his inspirational message.</p>

    Allow me to start by saying a huge thank you for taking time out of your
    busy life to read this book. If allowed, I believe this book has the
    potential to change your life. Okay, a grand and confident statement to
    make in the opening few lines, I know, but I really do believe it. This
    book is unique because every chapter is underpinned by a very real and
    honest life story. It is the story of the loud, aggressive,
    life-threatening cancer that tried to silence and put to rest the life of a
    young boy, aged just</p>

    16. It is a story that charts life's mountaintop moments and also its deep
    valley experiences. It is a story that has produced many nighttime tears,
    but also proves that joy really does come in the morning. It is a story
    that does not deny the facts of the diagnosis, but embraces the truth that
    miracles do still happen today. This is actually my story and my name is
    Dave.</p>

    own individual parts in this amazing thing called life. Life is a gift.
    Unfortunately this is not the dress rehearsal for it - it's the real thing.
    This is the thing that scares me – not a fear of life, quite the opposite,
    but a fear of not living. It has made me think. I imagine myself in my old
    age, in the last stages of life, within moments of taking my final breath
    here on planet earth, reminiscing on my journey up until this point. What
    if the last thought I ever had was, "If only." If only I had made the most
    of that opportunity . if only I had mended that broken relationship</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    . if only I had told that person that I loved them ... if only I had taken
    a few more risks and not played my life so safely ... if only I had shared
    my faith more ... if only I had turned the volume up in my life and lived
    it a little louder . if only.</p>

    Having faced life and death issues at such a young age I now have a
    perspective on life that some may not yet have. I hope to show you, through
    the words and pictures in this book, that this weird and wonderful
    experience called life is actually really incredible. Maybe as you hold
    this book you’re already feeling a little frustrated because, at this
    moment, for you life is more of a living nightmare than the adventure I've
    alluded to. Maybe you’ve just received a serious diagnosis or some other
    devastating news and currently life is throwing at you more questions than
    answers. Maybe you are carrying hurts and disappointments. Maybe you just
    feel weary and don't have the energy to progress or move forward.</p>

    If you fall into any of these categories you have picked up the right book.

    begin to live life out loud. We can both make the decision right now to
    change what our final thoughts in life will be. You may currently be on
    course to carry the weight of many "If only's", but you can use this guide
    to steer in a new direction - a direction that changes your "If only's"
    into "What a wonderful life."</p>

    Our allotted time here on planet earth is so short. Think back to this time
    last year. It's easy to look back and gasp, wondering where all the time
    went and why it went so fast. I want to make each moment count; I want to
    live each day as if it was my last. This passion I have for life - I
    believe you can have it too.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    This is the part where we become friends. The reason why we need to be
    friends before we continue is because, in the coming chapters, we have to
    establish a few things that can only be established on the basis of
    friendship. First of all, after reading this chapter, you will know that I
    am relatively normal. I use the word "relatively" with caution. There is
    nothing that special about me and I don't consider myself any different to
    the majority of others reading this book.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Secondly, this book is written with honesty. Some of the thoughts and
    experiences that are shared throughout it are very personal and still very
    real to this day. These are thoughts and experiences I can only share with
    people I can call my friends.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Thirdly, in places this book may offend those who are easily offended - not
    intentionally, of course, but out of a desire to be genuinely open about
    subjects that, for many, may be too close</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    to home. I hope though, that because of our new friendship, any offence
    will be short lived and you'll still love me at the end of it. If you are
    feeling that a commitment of this nature has come far too suddenly in our
    newfound relationship, don't worry! You have until the end of this chapter
    to decide if you would like to pursue this friendship or not.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    So, I'll start with my birth and quickly bring you to the place where I
    reach the age of 16. As the plot-spoiling title of this chapter suggests,
    my name is Dave. It's not the coolest of names that could have been chosen
    by my parents, Stuart and Irene, but nevertheless I suppose it is a solid
    one. I'm trying to picture the scene when my father held me in his arms for
    the very first time after the long hours of labour endured by Irene. He
    gazes down into my newly formed face, lifts my tiny body and holds me in
    the air (very similar to that moment in the Lion King) and says, "We shall
    name him ... Dave!" Given the choice I would have gone for something like
    "Wolf", "Jet" or "Zorro". It's funny thinking about it now, since baby
    names in this day and age are considered un-cool if they are easy to
    pronounce.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    So little baby Dave arrived in this world on the 19th September 1986,
    weighing 8lb 6oz. I was in a very blessed position to be born into a
    Christian home. Not only that, but to have a father who is a church Pastor.
    Stuart, my dad, had it in him to produce two more offspring in addition to
    myself. The first of which was older brother, Andrew, followed by older
    sister, Becki. I was the baby in the family by a good 10 years. Stuart and
    Irene have assured me on many occasions me that I was in fact planned ...
    anyway, moving on...</p>

    <p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Being the
    baby in the family did come with its benefits. Put</p>

    MEET DAVE</p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;"><br /></p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    quite simply, I was the favourite. As Andrew and Becki were of a similar
    age, it would usually be the both of them who got into disagreements rather
    than me. I can remember one incredible moment that took place where I was
    the sole witness in an argument between Andrew and Becki that took a turn
    for the worst. Just before I paint the scene, it would be good for you to
    know a little more about my siblings.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Let me start with Andrew. Andrew was the complete opposite to me. He was
    the more academic of the two Bell boys. Andrew's recreational time would
    consist of reading a large novel or some carrying out intense calligraphy
    work. My extracurricular activities would have included dressing up in my
    Superman outfit and jumping off our large garden wall. I think you see what
    I mean. As for Becki, let's just say that at the time, she was a teenage
    girl who knew very well how to use Andrew's more sensitive nature to her
    advantage.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Right, back to the story. Andrew and Becki were immersed in a fully-fledged
    argument that resulted in Andrew giving Becki a small clout to the back of
    the head. Becki then used her initiative, playing to Andrew's more
    compassionate nature, by pretending that this sudden blow has caused
    instantaneous blindness. Andrew, with fist raised high, was now made to
    feel responsible for inflicting a serious and life-changing disability on
    his younger sister. One word sums up the privilege of witnessing this
    historic act ... priceless!</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Let's learn a little more about Becki. She has always been one to ask
    questions. Whatever the subject, she is always keen to know every little
    detail. What should be a five-minute conversation with Becki has the
    tendency to last an hour due</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    to her intense interrogation. I am told that this was partially interesting
    when Becki was given that certain "talk" that most parents have to have
    with their children once they reach a particular age. I think you know the
    one I mean - the sex talk. I am told that the amount of questioning that
    resulted was well above the national average, compared to the chats that
    both Andrew and me received. What was more disturbing to me was the level
    of intrigue Becki had for the subject at hand. Part way through the talk my
    sister made a request to my mother: "Mum, I think it would be good idea if
    I watched you and Dad do it, so I know what it's all about." Outrageous,
    but brilliant at the same time. Classic Becki.</p>

    <p style=
    "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
    Let's jump forward to when I was around 12 years old. It was at this point
    in time when it became apparent that I had two main passions in life –
    sport and music. My love of sport probably developed simply because I found
    it difficult to sit still for longer than five minutes. My passion for
    music was probably passed down from my Dad. He tells me that he was a
    Christian rock star back in the day. I think the only part of that
    statement this is true is that he was definitely a Christian. That's
    possibly a little harsh</p>

        <p style="display: inline;">he was part of a successful band called the
        Advocates who produced many records and played at some very prestigious
        venues.</p>

            <p style=
            "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
            Sports-wise, I played soccer for my local team and scored 34 goals
            in my first season. I also loved playing rugby. It's a very
            satisfying feeling throwing someone to the ground and inflicting a
            little pain, all within the confines of "a game". Mum did not like
            attending my rugby matches for obvious reasons.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 29pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">
            But music was by far my greater passion. My musical career</p>

            began by learning the drums kindly provided by Santa. How he
            managed to get them down the chimney, I will never know, but they
            arrived and, with sticks in hand, I set out to be a drummer. After
            a few years of drumming I decided to place the sticks back on the
            shelf and took up the guitar. My Granddad kindly donated his
            acoustic guitar to get me started. I was pretty certain this
            "instrument" had been crafted just shortly before the wheel, but it
            seemed to work fine.</p>

            <p style=
            "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
            I would sit in front of the TV for hours watching Eric Clapton DVDs
            whilst strumming my little guitar. A defining moment came when
            watching the blockbuster hit <i>Back to the Future</i>. Remember
            the part where Michael J Fox picks up the guitar and starts to play
            <i>Johnny B Goode</i>? The determined character that I am would not
            rest until I was able to play this for myself.</p>

            <p style=
            "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
            Soon I formed a band with some close friends. The band was named
            <i>Anonymous</i>. It's a terrible name, I know, but it was
            apparently the best we could all come up with. Eventually
            <i>Anonymous</i> saw the light and decided a name change was in
            order, so we later became known as <i>Flint</i>. A little better
            but not exactly Coldplay. Flint began to attract a little following
            within the local scene and even recorded an EP. We even reached the
            heights of the local village carnival. After the departing of a few
            band members another name change was inevitable. Flint then became
            the mighty <i>Atlas</i>. We supported the likes of
            <i>Delirious?</i> And, on one occasion, American superstar Little
            Richard at a big charity event in London. My mum told me that we
            were the best band in the whole world, so it must have been
            true.</p>

            calendar: Christmas, my birthday and The One Event (formerly
            Grapevine). It has to be said that Grapevine was the highlight of
            my year. It was a large, family Bible weekend that took place every
            year. I even think it was equal to, if not slightly better than
            Christmas. I'm not suggesting that camping at a Christian festival
            on an agricultural show ground for five days is on a par with the
            birth of our Lord Jesus - but it does come pretty close! At the end
            of each event I would go into a season of mourning, commonly known
            as "the Grapevine Blues", which historically affected many people,
            especially me and my friends. Waking up on the Wednesday morning
            after the final night was the worst day in the year. Life just
            didn't seem worth living any more. At one point I even had the
            Samaritans on speed dial, just in case.</p>

            <p style=
            "padding-left: 17pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">
            Throughout my teenage years it was apparent that I was a bit of a
            practical joker and on most occasions I would cross the line in one
            way or another. Youth weekends away would often prove this fact. On
            one occasion I managed to conceal around ten different alarm clocks
            in the youth leader's dormitory, all set at fifteen-minute
            intervals starting at 3.00am. I found this prank really funny.
            Somehow I don't think she did.</p>

            I remember another occasion at a cell group meeting where I may
            have crossed the line again. As mentioned, I have trouble sitting
            still for very long. I have to be active or doing something or I
            tend to lose attentiveness. When it came to the prayer section of
            the evening I decided to sneak out through the back door for some
            fresh air. I saw a certain boy's bicycle lying there on the
            driveway. Me being me, I couldn't just walk past it without causing
            some sort of disruption to this innocent boy's journey home, so I
            decided to climb up the side of the house, dragging</p>

            the bike with me, and put it on top of the roof. I walked home with
            a grin on my face, wondering just how long it would take him to
            find his bike. Ingenious! Shortly after arriving home, however, I
            heard the phone ring. I could hear mum in the background,
            apologising profusely for the fact her son had gone too far
            again.</p>

            We're nearly up to date with the story. I hope after what you have
            heard so far we are still friends? Throughout these years the local
            church played a prominent role in my life. My parents educated and
            imparted to me the importance of church and church attendance from
            an early age. When having to make decisions such as playing for my
            local soccer team on a Sunday morning or going to church, the
            matter was clear cut and non- negotiable. Sometimes I would
            question if church was really that important. Surely the odd game
            of football wasn't much of an issue? But I believe God honoured my
            decision to put local church first by lining up a team that played
            the majority of its matches on a Sunday afternoon, meaning that
            church was always attended.</p>

            Okay, now you know all the important stuff about me. It's official
            - we're friends. Wahoo! At this point I would give you a rather
            awkward, but warm embrace; maybe even a small kiss.</p>

            Our story has brought us from my birth up to the young age of 16.
            Overall I was very content with life and rarely down. I had great
            relationships with family and friends and kept church a priority
            within my life. There was no room in my life for illness, struggle
            or setback. I could never really entertain such an idea. Like most
            16-year-old boys I also thought I was invincible and just presumed,
            like many, that such things as a serious illness or a major setback
            would not affect me. After all, I went to church,</p>

            Me at the age of 2. Not too happy with Irene's choice of clothing
            for me on this particular day. The white bear wearing a bow tie is
            enough, let alone a small wooden tambourine. Thanks Mum.</p>
